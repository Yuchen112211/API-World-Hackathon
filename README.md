### URL to authenticate

### Redirect URI
https://o2k881hv2k.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev_stage/auth/redirect

## Inspiration
- AWS good serverless services can provide good support to our service.

## What it does
This project provides a Serverless API for users to get up-coming activities and choose what they like. 
 
## How we built it
By using Lambda function, API gateway and DynamoDB, we transformed a server-based API to a Serverless API, and we designed an algorithm to filter data and optimized it to run well on Lambda function. 

## Challenges we ran into
- Integrate AWS Serverless components together
- Manage AWS roles, permissions
- Meetup event APIs require OAuth2.0
- Develop, collaborate and test on cloud instead of local machine

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
